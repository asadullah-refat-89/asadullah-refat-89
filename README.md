# 👋 Hi, I’m Asadullah Refat  
🚀 VP of Engineering | 🧠 Systems Thinker | 👨‍💻 Still a hands-on Coder

Engineer by training. Builder by instinct. Leader by responsibility.

For 11+ years, I’ve been designing, breaking, fixing, and scaling software systems (and the humans brave enough to build them with me). I work where **technology, people, and business reality collide**. Titles change. Craft doesn’t.

Currently, I’m the **Vice President of Engineering at Creolytix GmbH (Germany 🇩🇪)**, building platforms for **operational resilience**: real-time risk detection, analytics, and incident response.

Despite the leadership role and the occasional stage talk, I still code. A lot. Probably more than is medically advised (Wrote 1.8M+ lines of code in 2025) 😅!
